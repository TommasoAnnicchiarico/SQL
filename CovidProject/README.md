# CovidProject

The objective of this project is to analyze Covid-19 pandemic. 
Original dataset can be found at this link: https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths

In the SQL query I will show how I answered the following business questions:

#### 1.Calculate likelihood of dying if you contract covid
#### 2.What is the percentage of people who have gotten covid?
#### 3.Calculate infection rate per population
#### 4.Identify countries with highest deathcount
#### 5.Identify continent with highest deathcount and highest number of cases
#### 6.Calculate number of vaccinated people

Additionally, I connected MySQL to Tableau in order to visually analyze most relevant data. Here the link at the visualization:https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/tommaso.annicchiarico/viz/Covid-19Tracker_16845904987200/Covid-19Tracker
