# Hospital Management MYSQL project

As a data analyst, I will be using data obtained from 130 US hospitals from 1999-2008 to discover insights about hospital management process and determine hospital metrics.

The data set https://www.kaggle.com/code/iabhishekofficial/prediction-on-hospital-readmission/data?select=diabetic_data.csv is a real data set gotten from Kaggle and analyzed for educational purpose. This data set is from 1999-2008. It consists of two tables: health and demographics. The data set is focused only on patients with diabetics.

All the columns available in the dataset are listed below:
