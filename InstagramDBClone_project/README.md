As final project of the Udemy MYSQL for DataAnalysis and Business Intelligence course, I performed data analysis on an instagram_clone database.

The schema is built as follows:

The project will guide you trough the steps to answer 6 different business questions:

### 1.Find the  5 oldest users
### 2.What is the most popular registration day?
### 3.Find inactive user (students who never posted a photo)
### 4.Who got the most like in a single post?
### 5.Average number of photos per user
### 6.The 5 most commonly used hastag
### 7.Find users that have liked every single photo on the site (possibly bots)
